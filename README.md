## Project Highlights

### Interesting Implementation

One of the most interesting aspects of this project is the implementation of the dynamic sidebar navigation system. The `SideBar` component is designed with flexibility and reusability in mind, featuring:

- A responsive drawer that adapts to different screen sizes
- Smooth transitions for opening/closing animations
- Integration with Material-UI's theming system
- Type-safe navigation handling with TypeScript
- Persistent active tab state management

### Proudest Achievement

I'm particularly proud of the clean architecture and separation of concerns in the codebase. The project demonstrates:

- Well-structured component organization
- Comprehensive test coverage using React Testing Library
- Strong TypeScript typing throughout the application
- Maintainable and scalable code structure
- Consistent code style and formatting
